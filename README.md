# MS-prep
Data formatting and EDA for sieve-based MS, MS/MS data

This project has evolved a lot, and in crazy directions. The magrittr pipeline-based way of doing things has, in the meantime, become the de-facto Best Way Of Doing Things.
This is great, but it does mean that this project should probably be tweaked a bit to bring it more in line, now that it's no longer out in the weeds.
